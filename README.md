##**Tech Stack**
1.Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2.Backend: Node.js, Express.js
3.Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB
  Other Tools: Docker, Sequelize/TypeORM/Prisma (for database migrations and ORM), Postman (for API testing)

##**Pre-requisite**
1.Node.js (Version 16 or above): Download Node.js
2.Package Manager: npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn
3.Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB (ensure it's installed and running)

##**Migration & Seed Database Steps**
Database Migration:
*Manages and versions changes in database schema over time.
*Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production.
*Allows schema changes, rollbacks, and synchronization with the codebase.
*Tools: Sequelize CLI, Prisma Migrate, Flyway, Liquibase.

Database Seeding:
*Populates the database with initial or sample data (e.g., roles, settings, products).
*Facilitates development and testing with predefined datasets.
*Tools: Sequelize CLI, Prisma.

##**Running the App**
1.Install Dependencies:
Ensure all required dependencies are installed by running--npm install
2.Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file (if required) with necessary configurations like database credentials, API keys, etc.
3.Database Migration:
Apply the migrations to ensure the database schema is up-to-date-npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
4.Seed the Database:
Populate the database with initial data (if applicable)--npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
5.Start the Application:
Run the app in development mode--npm start
6.Access the App:
Open a browser and navigate to the URL ( http://localhost:3000).
